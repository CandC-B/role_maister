  "rules_text4":  "Once you've chosen your game mode, you can configure your game. You'll need to provide a brief description of the story's setting that you want to follow (including the condition to end the game) and create your character sheet.

  "guides_aliens_text1": "Aliens Role Game is typically set in a futuristic, space-faring universe where humanity and various alien species coexist. Players can choose from a variety of character roles, from spacefaring explorers to alien diplomats or mercenaries.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text2": "The game often employs a rule system that combines storytelling, character development, and dice mechanics. Players create characters with unique attributes and skills, and they engage with the game world through narrative interactions and dice rolls.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text3": "Players typically create characters by selecting a species (human or alien) and assigning attributes, skills, and backgrounds. These choices define a character's abilities and role in the game world.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text4": "Skills are character abilities that represent a character's expertise or proficiency in specific areas. Here's how to use them effectively:\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text5": "Characters should have a list of skills, each associated with a specific aspect of the game (e.g., diplomacy, combat, technology).\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text6": "The skills provide bonuses or advantages during relevant actions. For example, a character skilled in piloting might gain a bonus when flying a spaceship.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text7": "Talents are unique, character-specific abilities or traits that can be used to gain advantages in the game.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text8": "Specialized combat techniques, granting characters unique attacks or defenses.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text9": "Exceptional social talents like persuasion, intimidation, or diplomacy.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text10": "Technical talents for hacking, repair, or gadget creation.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text11": "Personal agendas add depth to character development and role-playing. Each character can have their own personal goals, desires, and motivations that may conflict or align with the overarching story.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text12": "Encourage players to create personal agendas for their characters that align with the game's themes and narrative.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text13": "You may receive rewards, story hooks, or character development opportunities related to achieving personal agendas.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text14": "Use personal agendas to introduce character dilemmas, moral choices, and conflicts that enrich the storytelling experience.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text15": "In Aliens Role Game, the dice mechanics provide a way to introduce uncertainty and randomness into the game, allowing players to determine the outcomes of character actions, combat, and various challenges.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text16": "Decide on the types of dice to be used in the game. For example, you can use a standard six-sided die (D6) for simple skill checks, a ten-sided die (D10) for more complex actions, and a twenty-sided die (D20) for critical or significant events.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text17": "Link character abilities, skills, and attributes to specific dice rolls. For example, a character with high negotiation skills might roll a D10 and add their charisma attribute to determine the outcome of a diplomatic encounter.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text18": "Define success thresholds for dice rolls. Players typically need to meet or exceed a target number (a 'success threshold') to succeed in their actions. The threshold can vary depending on the difficulty of the task.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text19": "Consider incorporating modifiers that can influence dice rolls. These modifiers can come from a character's skills, equipment, environmental factors, or other in-game circumstances.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text20": "Include mechanics for critical successes and critical failures. For instance, rolling the highest possible number on the die might result in an extraordinary success, while rolling the lowest could lead to a catastrophic failure.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text21": "Implement the concept of dice pools, where characters accumulate and roll multiple dice based on their abilities or advantages. The sum of the dice in the pool determines the result.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text22": "A Game Master (GM) guides the story and serves as the storyteller, controlling the non-player characters (NPCs), environments, and challenges that the player characters face. The GM helps to shape the narrative and adapt to player choices.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text23": "Players frequently encounter a wide variety of alien species, each with unique characteristics, abilities, and cultures. Diplomacy, negotiation, and combat can all come into play when dealing with these extraterrestrial beings.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text24": "The game encourages exploration of diverse alien worlds, space stations, and cosmic phenomena. This exploration often leads to the discovery of secrets, challenges, and new allies.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text25": "Combat may be an integral part of the game, with characters facing off against alien threats, pirates, or even other factions within the game universe. Use your equipment to defeat your enemiesâ€¦.and try not to panic too often, or youâ€™ll lose your sanity. The system should create tension, simulate fast-paced action, and allow for strategic decision-making.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text26": "Determine the order of actions in combat by using an initiative system. This can be based on characters' speed, skills, or a simple roll of the dice.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text27": "In combat, each character takes a turn during which they can perform a set number of actions. Typical actions include attacking, moving, using items, or taking cover.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text28": "When a character attempts to attack, they make an attack roll using the designated combat dice (e.g., D20). The roll's outcome, along with modifiers, determines if the attack hits the target.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text29": "Determine the amount of damage dealt by successful attacks. Different weapons or abilities may have varying damage values. Characters have a set amount of health (hit points), and taking damage reduces their health.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text30": "Characters may have armor or defensive abilities that reduce the damage taken. This adds strategy to combat as players must decide whether to prioritize defensive or offensive actions.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text31": "Incorporate critical hit mechanics where a specific result (e.g., rolling a natural 20) leads to a critical hit, inflicting extra damage. Allow for character-specific special abilities that can be used in combat for unique effects.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text32": "Introduce status effects, such as poison, bleeding, or stunned, which can affect characters during combat. Status effects can add complexity to battles.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text33": "Take into account character movement and positioning on the battlefield. Consider factors like cover, line of sight, and ranged combat ranges.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text34": "Characters may have a morale or bravery score that affects their combat performance. When characters witness disturbing events or are injured, their morale may drop, potentially causing them to flee or panic.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text35": "Panic mechanics add a psychological dimension to the Aliens Role Game, reflecting the stress and fear experienced by characters in intense or terrifying situations. Here's how panic can be integrated into the game\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text36": "Assign a panic threshold for each character. This threshold represents how much stress or fear a character can withstand before panicking. It can be influenced by character attributes and backgrounds.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text37": "Specify events or conditions that can trigger panic. These may include witnessing a horrific alien creature, being severely injured, or facing overwhelming odds in combat.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text38": "When a character's panic threshold is exceeded, they might suffer from panic effects. These effects could include:\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text39": "Reduced accuracy in combat.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text40": "Impaired decision-making, causing characters to make irrational choices.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text41": "A heightened likelihood of fleeing from danger.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text42": "Increased vulnerability to status effects like fear or confusion.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text43": "Characters may have a chance to recover from panic over time, with support from other characters, or by taking specific actions to calm themselves.\n\n",
  "guides_aliens_text44": "Feel encouraged to role-play your characterâ€™s fear and stress during panic situations. This adds depth to the narrative and immerses players in the game's atmosphere.\n\n",
